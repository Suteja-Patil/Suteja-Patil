I'm an aspiring data scientist with an objective to use data in solving real world problems. I believe data has the power to elevate a business and am in the process of learning different algorithms to implement the same. I'm interested in Machine learning, Natural Language Processing, Deep learning and Data Visualization. I like collaborating with people from diverse backgrounds and data driven mindsets. 

Let's connect,learn and grow together!
