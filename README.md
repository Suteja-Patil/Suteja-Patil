### Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Suteja

I'm a graduate student at Northeastern University in Boston. I believe data has the power to elevate a business and am in the process of learning different techniques to implement the same. I am interested in Machine learning, Natural Language Processing, Deep learning and Data Visualization. I like collaborating with people from diverse backgrounds and data driven mindsets. 

Let's connect,learn and grow together!
